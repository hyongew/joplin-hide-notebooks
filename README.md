# Hide Notebooks

This is a plugin for Joplin that allows you to hide notebooks. Simply right-click any notebook and select 'Hide Notebook' to hide it. Go to ```View -> Show hidden notebooks``` to show hidden notebooks.

You can also hide 'All Notes' and 'Trash' in ```View``` or ```Tools -> Options -> Hide Notebooks```.

# Known Issues

* 'All notes' can still be accessed with keyboard keys when hidden.
* Hidden notes still visible in 'All notes'.
* Hiding or unhiding notebooks will cause all notebooks in the sidebar to flash briefly.
* If 'Trash' is hidden while a trashed folder is currently selected, it will remain selected.
